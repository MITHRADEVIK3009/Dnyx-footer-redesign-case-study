# Behind the Screens: What My Internship at a Design Agency Actually Taught Me

During my three-month internship at a design agency from July to September 2024, I worked on improving a production website component the footer. While the output itself appears compact, the experience behind it was layered with learning that went far beyond designing a UI element.

Rather than treating this internship as a checklist of tasks, I treated it as an opportunity to understand how professionals think when they build products how decisions are made, how ideas are evaluated, and how constraints shape execution.

## The First Phase: Observing Before Acting

The initial week were not about designing anything. They were about understanding.

Before putting together a single proposal, a significant amount of time was spent reviewing:

- How the website functioned as a system  
- How design consistency was maintained across pages  
- How navigation structures influenced readability  
- How visual hierarchy affected comprehension  

This phase was less about "doing" and more about reading patterns  noticing what worked, what felt heavy, what looked unclear, and what could be structured better.

## Defining the Scope

One of the most useful lessons during the internship was understanding *what not to change*.

When working within existing systems, effectiveness does not come from redesigning everything. It comes from making improvements that integrate naturally into what already exists.

The footer was chosen as a focused improvement area because it influences:

- Navigation  
- Trust perception  
- Information access  
- Structural clarity across the site

## Designing with Intent (Not Excess)

A common instinct while designing is to provide many options. In production environments, however, more options create more confusion.

Instead of producing multiple directions, the work focused on fewer variations built with stronger logic. Every proposal was intentional:

- Spacing followed purpose  
- Font sizes followed hierarchy  
- Color followed readability  
- Layout followed user flow

## Work Beyond the Deliverable

While the footer redesign was the primary output, the internship experience extended beyond design execution.

Over time, I focused on:

- Understanding technical dependencies in implementation  
- Adapting feedback into practical design revisions  
- Working within time and feasibility boundaries  
- Aligning output with project direction  

These efforts refined how I think about working on products, not just interfaces.

## Iteration as a Process

The real work was not finalizing a design it was iterating responsibly.

Revisions did not indicate failure. They indicated refinement.

Focus gradually shifted from presentation to purpose:

- Clarity over decoration  
- Consistency over creativity  
- Function over features  

---

## Designing Inside Constraints

Every improvement exists within limits:

- Time  
- Feasibility  
- Maintainability  
- Alignment with existing systems  

Learning to work inside these constraints sharpened decision-making and execution quality.

---

## Why This Experience Matters

This experience reinforced a principle that applies far beyond design:

Good products are not built by people who only produce output.  
They are built by people who observe, decide, prioritize, and simplify.

---

## Closing Reflection

This internship strengthened:

- Decision ownership  
- Execution discipline  
- Professional collaboration  
- Growth through iteration  

It confirmed that meaningful skill development often happens quietly, through practice rather than display.
