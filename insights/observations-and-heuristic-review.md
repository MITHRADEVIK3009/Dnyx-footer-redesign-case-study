# Observations & Heuristic Review (Previous Footer)

Common user expectations for agency footers:
- Immediate visibility of contact number and location
- Clear service categories
- Easy access to Privacy Policy and Terms
- Social proof / follow links

Issues identified:
- Contact number and location were present but not prominent
- Link grouping was inconsistent
- Text contrast was sufficient on desktop but tight on mobile
- Overall density slightly reduced scannability

These observations directly guided the redesign priorities.
