### Context
DNYX Technologies is a full-service digital agency offering web development, UI/UX design, and related solutions from Chennai, India. During my two-month internship I was tasked with redesigning the website footer — a component visible on every page.

### Objective
Improve clarity, trust signals, and overall usability of the footer while maintaining complete consistency with the existing blurred-golden visual theme.

### Key Contributions
- Analysed the previous footer for readability, hierarchy, and user expectations  
- Delivered three carefully refined variations (instead of 7–9) to streamline internal decision-making  
- Ensured prominent placement of contact details, location, privacy policy, and services  
- Optimised spacing, contrast, and mobile experience  
- Collaborated directly with the Founder throughout the process
