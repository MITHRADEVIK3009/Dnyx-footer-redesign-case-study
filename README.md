### Objective
Redesign the global website footer to improve:
- Clarity and visual hierarchy

- Overall professionalism while staying 100% true to the existing blurred-golden brand theme

<br>

### Key Contributions
- Conducted heuristic review of the previous footer
- Delivered **only three refined variations** (instead of 7–9) to respect stakeholder decision-making time
- Introduced logical four-column structure and prominent trust elements
- Optimized spacing, contrast, and tap-target sizes for mobile
- Collaborated directly with the Founder & CEO throughout iterations

**Final Designs** → [/solution/final-designs/](solution/final-designs/)

### Selected Outcome & Feedback
The direction was praised for its clarity and intentional restraint.

> “The clarity and restraint in option selection made decision-making easier. Each version felt purposeful and aligned with our brand.”  
> — **Rudhresh S**, Founder & CEO, DNYX Technologies

|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Number of options       | Only 3 final versions                      | Prevent decision fatigue                        |

| Golden accent usage     | High-contrast while preserving brand theme | Consistency + accessibility                    |
| Link reduction          | Removed redundancy                         | Lower cognitive load                            |

### Reflections
- Presenting fewer, higher-quality options significantly speeds up alignment  
- Direct founder access enabled rapid, high-impact feedback loops  
- Even small components like footers play a major role in perceived professionalism  
- Balancing creativity with clarity and restraint is critical in real-world projects
